      <h2>Udacity Reflection - Part 1</h2>

      <h3>Design and structural features I liked:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Some form of (relevant) full screen background image OR</li>
        <li>Use of gradient colours</li>
        <li>Navigation menu</li>
        <li>Box layout -responsiveness - perhaps using flex boxes</li>
        <li>Complementary Fonts</li>
        <li>modern - styling ie more minimal than cluttered</li>
        <li>Universal style - so is the same/familiar on each page</li>
        <li>Styled Links (hover colour, visited colour etc) where relevant</li>
        <li>Standardised headings across all pages</li>
        <li>Buttons</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to describe HTML and CSS</h3>
      <p>
        The best, and most frequently used analogy is that HTML is frame of a house, it provides the structure and basic layout and content of the page, however on its own everything is pretty dull. CSS provides all the decoration - the colour, the styling, sizes, simple animations and transitions etc. Much like how paint, knickknacks and furnishings give go over the frame and give personality to a house, CSS gives personality to a webpage and makes it look good!

      <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
      <p>
        Given that webpages are frequently made up of may different boxes being able to boxify a design is a method of looking at a webpage design, and then figuring out how each section can fit into a 'box'. This can be done a number of ways, either on the computer using some form of editing program, or by printing off a design and using a pen, pencil or scissors.

      <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
      <p>
        This is a model where each section of a webpage is made up one or more 'boxes' that contain certain content such as  a logo, navigation bar, image, links, works, titles etc. The importance of box design is that it not only allows designers and developers to more easily move components around and develop a site, but it helps to ensure the web page will display correctly across a range of different screen sizes, and devices - ie PC, tablet and mobile.
