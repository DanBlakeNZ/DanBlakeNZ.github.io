    <h1>Reflections on the Q & session with Sherif from DBC</h1>
    <p>
      I enjoyed listening to Sherif explain his vision beheind Dev Boot Camp as well as provide reasoning/justification for including certain aspects into the course.

      My take on the EDA experience is that it is set up to challenge not just students, but also to challenge the traditional education system. As Sherif mentioned throughout his chat, bootcamps are something of an experiment - there are no grades or exams and the curriculum  is evolving as the 'experiment' is refined (like all good experiments!).
      It's clear that this is a different style of learning than say university, where you spend 3+ years being told what to learn, when to learn and what you should know for an exam. Once that exam is done you tend of jump for joy and then forget a lot of what you learnt as you move on to working hard to pass the next paper! A few years later you come out with a degree and start wondering what's next. It's clear that while DBC/EDA have a set curriculum that focuses on the technical aspect what makes them different from a traditional education institution is the focus on developing soft skills along side developing the technical ability. It seems every student is taking part because they are interested in web development, they want to be there, they want to learn, they want to put in the time and effort and at the end of it they know that they will have the skills to work as a successful developer.

      My impressions so far is that EDA is a place build around respect, learning and personal as well as professional development and as such it is well placed to provide us with an engaging curriculum and teachers who are just as passionate about our success as we are! It seems that we will definitely be challenged both technically but also in terms of how we work with others – something that will be vital once out in the work place,  and something that Sherif noted on multiple occasions is actually going to be just as, if not more valuable to an employer than someones technical skills.

      I can see myself being highly engaged with this type of culture. Sherif noted in his session that the culture is focused on fostering learning and collaboration, not on fostering competition between classmates or seeing who can the best grades. This is something that I have heard Rohan and others at EDA talk about as well.  I think this is a great culture to have as it fosters not just individual learning, but group learning as well. This culture will also be important once in the workplace, being able to open share ideas helps the group grow not just the individual and thus everyone improves and the end output of everyones work will be improved!

      I don’t believe my exceptions have changed,  if anything watching Sherif’s talk has just reinforced my expectations for what I’m undertaking over the next few months. It’s going to be an intense few months filled with a full spectrum of emotions (and also plenty of coffee!), but will ultimately be rewarding both personally and professionally.

      I’m really excited to be part of this learning environment, I like its openness and that feeling of 'we are all in this together' – very different from the more singled minded individual experience you tend to get when studying at university. I’m not too nervous (should I be?!) but I’m excited and looking forward to challenging myself and being part of this ‘experiment’ with all the other guinea pigs who are also equally passionate and motivated!
