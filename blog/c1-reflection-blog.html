    <h1>Reflections on the Q &amp; A  session with Sherif from DBC</h1>
    <p>
      I enjoyed listening to Sherif explain his vision beheind Dev Boot Camp as well as provide reasoning/justification for including certain aspects into the course.

    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>

    <p>
      My take on the EDA experience is that it is set up in a way to challenge not only the students, but also the traditional education model. It is clear that we will be steeping into a different style of learning than say university, where you would go and spend 3+ years being told what to learn, when to learn and what you should know for an exam. Once that exam is done you tend of jump for joy and then forget a lot of what you learnt as you move on to working hard to pass the next paper! A few years later you come out with a degree and start wondering what's next. At EDA/DBC students go in with a real interest in pursuing a development career and the motivation to succeed - it is clear from listening to Sherif that the motivation needs to be there, because the course is doing something different, it is fast paced and it crams a lot of learning into a short amount of time.

      My key takeout is that EDA will do everything they can to set us on the right path, but to really get the most out of this course and style of learning it is up to the student to set their goals, to work hard, and to put in the time required to succeed - like the old saying goes "you get out what you put in". Luckily it seems every student is taking part because they are interested in web development, they want to be there, they want to learn, they want to put in the time and effort and at the end of it they know that they will walk away at graduation knowing that they have the skills to work as a successful developer!

    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
    <p>
      My impressions so far is that EDA is a place build around respect, learning and personal as well as professional development and as such it is well placed to provide us with an engaging curriculum and teachers who are just as passionate about our success as we are! It seems that we will definitely be challenged both technically but also in terms of how we work with others – something that will be vital once out in the work place, this is something that Sherif noted on multiple occasions is actually going to be just as, if not more valuable to an employer than someone’s technical skills.

    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
    <p>
      I can see myself being highly engaged with this type of culture - a culture is focused on challenging oneself and on fostering learning and collaboration with others, not on fostering competition between classmates or seeing who can the best grades. This is something that I have heard Rohan and others at EDA talk about as well.  I think this is a great culture to have as it fosters not just individual learning, but group learning as well. This culture will also be important once in the workplace, being able to open share ideas helps the group grow not just the individual and thus everyone improves and the end output of everyone’s work will be improved!

    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
    <p>
      I don’t believe my exceptions have changed, if anything watching Sherif’s talk has just reinforced my expectations for what I’m undertaking over the next few months. It’s going to be an intense few months filled with a full spectrum of emotions (and also plenty of coffee!), but will ultimately be rewarding both personally and professionally

    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
    <p>
      I’m really excited to be part of this learning environment, I like its openness and that feeling of 'we are all in this together' – very different from the more singled minded individual experience you tend to get when studying at university or at other traditional education providers. I’m not too nervous yet (should I be?!) but I’m excited and looking forward to challenging myself and being part of this ‘experiment’ with all the other guinea pigs who are also equally passionate and motivated!
