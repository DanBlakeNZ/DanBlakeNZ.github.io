      <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
      <p>
        Grid based design, is the design of a webpage based on ordering content based on an invisible grid that is across your webpage. This grid design is used in conjunction with the users natural eye flow of reading from left to right and top to bottom. Thinking of the page as a gird, when combined with understanding how a user is likely to look at a page helps designers and developers to organise content, and draw users to a certain section or sections of a page.

      <h3>What’s all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
      <p>
        Responsive web design is vital given the wide range of devices users are using to browse the web. In the past developers’ would create a site specifically for desktop and another specifically for mobile - essentially they have built two separate sites. However, responsive sites allow developers to create one site that will dynamically adjust itself to provide the user the best experience regardless of what device they are using to view the page.

      <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
      <p>
        Semantic structure is the use of html tags that make sense to both the web browser and to and people who are reading them. They are tags such as &lt;h1&gt; for heading, &lt;nav&gt; for navigation or &lt;img&gt; for image.

      <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h3>
      <p>
        Having spent 3 years working for an agency that specialises in mobile marketing, advertising and development it was constantly surprising how little clients cared about their mobile site or mobile strategy, despite the fact that mobile users were counting for an increasing amount of traffic to their site. Making sure your websites are responsive is vitally important as it provides users with the best user experience and so I found the grid system and it all comes together to be really interesting. I think that it is great that responsive design and the importance of mobile is being taught and emphasized so early on in this course!
