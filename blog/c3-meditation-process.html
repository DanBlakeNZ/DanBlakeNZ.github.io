      <h4>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h4>
      <p>
        Overall I found the process to be good, but challanging in that at times I wanted to focus more on the product. However, one of the things I struggle with is actually designing a site and so I found this process to be a great starting point. Going through the sprint material helped provide context around things such as why you should take a mobile first approach, and what sort of things you should think about when designing a site. I think its good to get into the mindset of focusing on the process and so as to ensure you can produce a well thought out product.

      <h4>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h4>
      <p>
        I have been trying meditation in the week or so prior to reading this chapater, so I had a basic understanding of meditation, how you go about it and some of its benefits. This chapater I felt more reenforced what (little!) I already know about meditation.
      </p>
      <h4>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h4>
      <p>
        I found the concept that meditation is a bit like riding a bicycle quite interesting. When riding a bike you are constantly making small, quick micro-adjustments to stay balanced and upright, meditation is similar in that it helps to train your brain's meta-attention - that is your brain's ability to quickly recover from wandering attention and focus on the task at hand. I also found interesting the "happiness is the default state of mind" concept, where your default state is to be happy when you mind is calm and clear.
      </p>
      <h4>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
      <p>
        I think the 4 step plan of working through distractions is going to be useful, since distractions are constant when trying to meditate. That is when you are distracted, trying to follow the following steps:
        <ul>
          <li>Acknowledge.</li>
          <li>Experience without judging or reacting.</li>
          <li>If you need to react, contine maintaining mindfulness.</li>
          <li>Let it go.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
