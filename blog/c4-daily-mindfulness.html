      <h4>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h4>

      <p>
        When you stopping and actively listening to another person and what they are saying I found myself being able to ‘hear’ and absorb the notion of what is being said much more effectively. While as the speaker I found that I had the time to express my ideas, opinions and thought’s much more effectively without being stopped and losing my train of thought.
        The other person also found it similar, and we agreed that this method can really help to focus on listening to and understanding what the other person is saying.
      </p>

      <h4>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>
      <p>
        I like the idea of the “Do less than you can” technique as it seems most relevant to me at this point in time. I understand the benefits of meditation after sitting and focusing for 5 minutes the mind starts to wonder off and look for other things to do, thus making meditation less ‘fun’ and feel like more of a chore at times. I like that idea of “Do less than you can” not because I just do less, but because I can see the benefits of doing less – if you do say 3 minutes then it will be 3 minutes that you are having ‘fun’ doing mediation, rather than doing 3 minutes of ‘fun’ meditation and 2 minutes of ‘not-so-fun’ meditation. You are much more like to keep coming back to do 3 minutes of ‘fun’ meditation each day rather than 5 minutes of ‘mixed-fun’ meditation that will start to feel like a chore. Then as you progress you can up the amount of time.
