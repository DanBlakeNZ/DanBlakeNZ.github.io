      <h4>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h4>
      <p>
        As of yet I haven't tried any of the timebox or habit techniques mentioned, however I'm keen to try out a few of them over the coming week!
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>What did you find interesting?</h4>
      <p>
        I found the article discussing meditation and its effects on the brain interesting. Meditation is something I really don't know anything about, so it was intersting to read about how it affects the brain in different ways and what that means in a more practical sense in terms of increasing creativity, focus, compassion, memory and reducing stress and anxiety.
        I also found the Pomodoro technique intersting as it is something I have heard about previously, but didn't actually know what it was!
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>What worked for you?</h4>
      <p>
        As mentioned I have yet to put any of the mentioned techniques into practice as of yet (but will do!), but I know form personal expereince that making small changes can help to create a habit - and alot of that also comes down to mindset and having a clear goal in mind. Once you get into the swing of the small habit, it then becomes rotuine and should hopefully put you on the path to achieving whatever goal the habit was tied to.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Which will you experiment further with?</h4>
      <p>
        Admitidly I'm a bit of a sceptic when it comes to meditation, partly because I've never really felt it's something i want to/should do and partly because I probably haven't really known enough about it, but with that being said the article lists some clear benefits and so will be willing to give it a crack and see how I go!
        Would also be really keen to try the Pomodoro technique as well as it seems to be both popular and successful and will hopefully keep me on track and distraction free!
