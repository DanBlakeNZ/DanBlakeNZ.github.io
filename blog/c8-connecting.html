      <h4>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h4>
      <p>
        Life looks good! Being able to acknowledge, understand and recognise each of the three points alows us to enjoy the smaller things as well us understand what drives and motivates us when working towards bigger goals. By having a purpose and working towards something we belive and are interested in, we can lead happier lives and enjoy all moments, big and small.
      </p>

      <h4>What are your core values? What do you stand for?</h4>
      <p>
        My core values are based around integertry, self respect and respect of others, as well as working towards personal imporovment. I stand for having strong, genuine relationships with friends, family and collegues as well as as respecting other peoples ideas and or beiliefs, even if I might not agree with them.

      </p>
      <h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>
      <p>
        I found the ideas that successfull people tend to also be more optimistic people interesting, and how that optimistic people tend to view any failures as something that is only only short-term and due to isolated, particular circumstances. I would say I jump between being optimistic and pessamestic, although generally generally lean towords having a more optimisitic view as I believe it is important to learn from any setbacks or failures - everyone has failures and setback and failures are just another form of learning and help to point you down the road to success.
