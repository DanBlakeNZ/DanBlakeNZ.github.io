      <h4>A simple problem and how I solved it</h4>
      <p>
        I was trying to get my JavaScript code to display several lines of a single character, with each character separated by a space. The number of characters (including the spaces) on each  line was determined by a number given by the user, eg if the user entered 10 then a total of 10 characters would be displayed, although 5 of them would actually be spaces so would appear blank. Once 10 characters had been displayed, a new line would be displayed again with 10 character. This would continue on until 10 lines had been displayed. However, the key thing was that each line should alternate between starting with a visible character or a blank ‘space’. The problem I was having was that the number of characters on each line was only 9 characters long in total.<br>
        I was using a for loop nested inside another for loop, with the last iteration of the loop creating a new line. I wasn’t too sure why this was happening at the time, but I used the source console to follow each step of the loop and quickly saw that rather than printing a character or space on the last instance of the loop that it was creating a new line, so I quick realized that the new line needed to be placed elsewhere, and so I ended up moving it inside the first loop, so a new line was created before the second loop ran and created each character.
        At the time I was a little frustrated as I was sure it should be working, it was so close but I couldn’t quite figure it out. But once I stopped, and debugged the problem using the console I quickly realized my issue and the error in logic in my code!
        I learned that taking a step back and looking at how the code runs step by step in the console’s source tab is a valuable tool for debugging and can quickly help identify any bugs, or errors in logic!

      <h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> I’m fairly confident with this technique as provides a way of thinking about a problem and creating a solution using human language without getting bogged down with technical terms or language.<br>
        <strong>Trying something:</strong> I will usually try doing something to fix the bug, sometimes it might just be reading though the code and trying to understand and identify where the problem lies, and trying something to fix it – sometimes it works, sometimes not.<br>
        <strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> I haven’t used this technique as of yet, and so currently wouldn’t be that confident in using it.<br>
        <strong>Reading error messages:</strong> Some I can understand what they are saying, other’s I cannot. However I know where I can find the line that is causing an error message, and that gives me a starting point, even if I’m not sure what the meaning of the message is.<br>
        <strong>Console.logging:</strong> I use this frequently to help understand any issues as well as track the status of certain objects to make sure they are working as they should.<br>
        <strong>Googling</strong>: Being able to ask the right question is certainly an art form, but one I feel that I am getting better at and am confident in doing.<br>
        <strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong> I have yet to do this as of yet as there hasn’t been the need to, however I would be happy to see if anyone else can provide a solution should I get really stuck on a particular problem!<br>
        <strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> I would be confident in asking for help from a coach, as they possess a wealth of experience and can help me solve it, or at least point me in the right direction!<br>
        <strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong> Each time I solve a problem I tend of look back and make a mental note of some of the steps that worked/didn’t work. I think the more I gain an awareness of how I’m tackling an issues, the better I will be at improving my reflection process.

      <h4>Describe what these functions do in your own words:</h4>
      <p>
        <gstrong>.map()</strong>
        The map method is used to iterate through each element of the array. For each element in the array it will change them in some way, it will then create a new array with the values that have been modified.<br>
        <gstrong>.filter()</strong>
        The filter method is used to iterate through an array and filter out elements where a condition is true. For example if an array element has a value ‘cat’ it will remove this from the array. If need be then ‘cat’ could be assigned to another array or variable, otherwise it will simply be removed.<br>
        <gstrong>.reduce()</strong>
        The reduce method is used to iterate through an array and condense it into one value. For example if you had an array containing 5 different numbers, the reduce method will go through the array and combine each number (add, subtract etc). The end result will be that a single number is returned.
